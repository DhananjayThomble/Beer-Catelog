# Beer-Catelog

This app has a single screen that shows a list of 10 random beers, with the name, brand and
alcohol content of each beer shown. This list is automatically refreshed every 10 seconds
with new beers and their information.

The list of beers will be fetched in JSON from HTTP server.
For beers with alcohol content less than 5%, their name should be displayed in green
and the rest of beers should have their name in red.

Each time the app refreshes the list, it can show a
random number of beers, ranging from 2 to 100 beers.
