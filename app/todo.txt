Implement a simple Android Beer Catalog app that runs on all Android devices running
Android Version 8.1+. This applicationâ€™s purpose is to fetch information about different kinds
of beers from a remote HTTP server and display them to the user as a list.

The app has a single screen that shows a list of 10 random beers, with the name, brand and
alcohol content of each beer shown. This list is automatically refreshed every 10 seconds
with new beers and their information.

The list of beers will be fetched in JSON from HTTP server via a GET request using
the following URL:

https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/beers?size=10&response_type=json
